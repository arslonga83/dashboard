#Personal Dashboard

This is a personal dashboard project that can be used as a chrome extension. The main project spec from Scrimba includes time, cryptocurrency info, and weather. I added a formatted date and included a loading svg for the weather section because it tends to be a bit slow to load. 

This project is ongoing and I would like to expand it...things to try adding would be an embedded search function, random music or video, todo list, calendar info, etc...also at some point I should build a backend so I can get the api key out of this code.
